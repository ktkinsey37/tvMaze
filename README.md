# tvMaze

TvMaze is an app designed to help the user with finding tv shows and episodes. It works by simply searching for a show's title in the search bar. This will bring up a list of the closest matching shows according to the TV Maze api, which will include an image of the show, the name, and a summary of the show. The shows that match will each have a "Get Episodes" button, which, when clicked, will bring up a list of episodes for that series, including information about the episodes title, season, and number.
